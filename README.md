# 📊 Databricks SQL & Spark SQL: Data Intelligence and Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases practical projects and analytical applications developed using **Databricks SQL** and **Spark SQL in Python**. The projects serve as a culmination of skills acquired from DataCamp's intensive courses: **"Introduction to Databricks SQL"** and **"Introduction to Spark SQL in Python."**

The focus is on applying modern data engineering practices within the **Lakehouse Architecture** and executing advanced business intelligence (BI) analysis on a hyper-scalable platform.

## 🌟 Key Competencies Demonstrated

* **Databricks SQL & Lakehouse:** Implementing scalable data warehousing solutions and managing data flow through the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) for optimal performance and governance.
* **Spark SQL in PySpark:** Leveraging the distributed computing power of Apache Spark alongside Python for Big Data processing using high-performance, **ANSI SQL-compliant** queries.
* **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Proficient use of **Window Functions** for complex analytical tasks, including time-series analysis (running sums/differences), fast-changing data handling, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) feature engineering.
* **Data Engineering Workflows:** Performing ETL/ELT operations, including complex dataset merging (using `MERGE` statements) and implementing best practices for data storage and updates.
* **Business Intelligence & Visualization:** Creating in-platform visualizations and interactive **Databricks Dashboards** to effectively communicate data stories and business insights.
